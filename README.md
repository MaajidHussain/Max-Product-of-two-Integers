# Max-Product-of-two-Integers

# Two codes with slight different logic will be seen here.
# Last code with good efficiency.

1.first code:
            where the logic dosen't work if higher elements are repeted.
            
2.second code:
            where logic work's even if the higher elements are repeated.

3.Third code:
            Where it can't handle if the higher elements get's repeated;
            But this is very much efficient as compare to above 2 codes.
